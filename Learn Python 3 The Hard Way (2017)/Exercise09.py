#Printing strings on multiple lines can make text more readable to humans.
#With multiple lines, strings can be grouped into clean and orderly text, formatted as a letter, or used to maintain the linebreaks.
#To create strings that span multiple lines, triple single quotes ''' or triple double quotes """ are used to enclose the string.
#With triple quotes, you can print strings on multiple lines to make text, especially lengthy text, easier to read.

Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.""")
